    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. \n",
    "* **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    " * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
    " * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran. \n",
    "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environment, packages and documentation spread out at different places. Can make it harder to get started."
